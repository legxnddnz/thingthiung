                    <p>By clicking "I Agree," you acknowledge that while the visuals were rendered using AI, the Soul of this project is 100% human. Every location, every vibe, and every specific milestone was hand-picked and architected by me over the last several weeks. The technology was simply the brush used to paint the version of the future I see in my head every day.</p>
